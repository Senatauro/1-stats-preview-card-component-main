## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

There was some time that I didnt used React or HTML/CSS/JS, so I took a little longer that I should have to. This challenge is easy to make, not much to talk about here.

### Continued development

For my continued development I need to keep doing challenges with React, coding projects with HTML and CSS and it would be good to start learning a styling framework like [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) or [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). 

Right now I'm starting with the AWS Amplify Studio UI to make Figma components into react components (not used in this challenge). AWS Amplify is really cool
